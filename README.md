# Real-time-Face-Mask-Alert-System
This is a deep learning project based on real time face mask detection along with an alert system . The purpose to make this system was due to the covid -19 protocols .
The coronavirus disease 2019 has already infected more than 20 million people and caused over 750 thousand deaths globally according to the situation report 96 of the World Health Organization(WHO).
Face mask detection is a system that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
This system can be implemented in many areas such as supermarkets and shopping malls, schools, colleges, stations and so on.
Face detection has proved to be one of the most promising and reliable biometric traits involving applications in video surveillance, forensic, competitive exams, jobs and various commercial areas.
Face mask detection using CNN(convolution neural networks) with a alert system The objective of this proposed
system is to achieve interoperability by using an automated system which will allow or deny the individual from
entering the critical premises. It is also necessary to find an optimal model for identifying images with mask
and without mask. The proposed system is different as it is an alert system which triggers an email to concerned
authorities and also triggers a voice alert in three different languages. 
Datasets:
In our proposed system we are using datasets consisting of image frames. We select appropriate features and thus
classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not using CNN.
Features:
The features that we have considered to identify whether a person wore a mask or not. Face detection: The face
will be detected in the frame with help of APIâ€™s and opencv algo. Mask detection: The opencv using CNN will
detect if the person has his mask on or no
